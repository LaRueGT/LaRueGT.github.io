        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            I'm an ambitious nerd with a big personality. I tend to attack my problems head on and prefer brutal honesty over comforting
            stories.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm concerned about our digital rights, particularly with software patents and net neutrality, but I am weary of the constant
            efforts to encroach upon them. I also care a lot about the challenges men in my generation are facing, to me
            there is too little concern among the population for many troubling issues facing guys.

        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>
            I was born in California but moved to North Carolina at a young age. I consider myself from a small southern town
            even though I never picked up the accent.

        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>
            I spend a lot of time reading, particularly fantasy, scifi and pointless trivia. I enjoy
            occasional 3d modeling and music production projects. I'm currently teaching myself to play the linnstrument.
        </p>
        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>
            I'd like to be a software developer for some kind of mission critical system, like a financial
            platform, robot control system or vehicle. My favorite projects have always been those that have tangible impact
            on the real world.
        </p>
        <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm really enjoying this synthwave/outrun genre that has popped up on my
            soundcloud these past couple years. Lazerhawk, Perturbator, and Kavinsky are notable artists making that style
            of music.
